# Rough Project Plan:

## Month 1: Project Initialization and Literature Review

### Week 1-2: Project Kick-off and Planning
- Define project objectives and deliverables.
- Create a detailed project timeline.
- Set up project management tools and documentation practices.

### Week 3-4: Literature Review and Technology Setup
- Conduct a comprehensive literature review on RNNs, stock option pricing, and TensorFlow.
- Install and set up Python, TensorFlow, and any other required software.
- Familiarize yourself with TensorFlow and RNNs through tutorials and documentation.

## Month 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Week 1-2: Data Collection
- Collect historical data of North American large-cap equities and their associated options.
- Ensure data includes 'at the money' options with short-term expiration.

### Week 3-4: Data Preprocessing
- Clean and preprocess the collected data.
- Handle any missing or inconsistent data.
- Normalize and transform data as required for the RNN.

## Month 3: Model Development - Part 1

### Week 1-2: Initial Model Setup
- Set up the initial RNN model using TensorFlow.
- Define the model architecture and input parameters (stock price, volatility, interest rates).

### Week 3-4: Model Training and Validation - Iteration 1
- Train the RNN model using the preprocessed data.
- Validate the model's performance using a subset of the data.
- Analyze the results and adjust the model parameters as necessary.

## Month 4: Model Development - Part 2

### Week 1-2: Model Iterations
- Continue iterating on the model, adjusting parameters and architecture as needed.
- Validate the model using recent stock data to assess prediction accuracy.

### Week 3-4: Model Optimization
- Optimize the model for better performance and accuracy.
- Ensure the model's predictions align within the future bid-ask spread.

## Month 5: Documentation and Result Presentation

### Week 1-2: Comprehensive Documentation
- Document the development, implementation, and validation of the RNN.
- Ensure all code is well-commented and documentation is clear and thorough.

### Week 3-4: Result Analysis and Presentation
- Analyze the final results of the model.
- Prepare a presentation of the results, highlighting key findings and potential areas for improvement.\

## Month 6: Finalization and Submission

### Week 1-2: Final Revisions and Testing
- Conduct final tests and revisions on the model and documentation.
- Ensure everything is ready for submission.

### Week 3-4: Thesis Submission and Defense Preparation
- Submit the final version of your thesis.
- Prepare for the thesis defense, ensuring you are ready to discuss your project in detail.
